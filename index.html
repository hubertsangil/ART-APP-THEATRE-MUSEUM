        <p>The theatrical art form can be referred to by the term "theater". Theater is a dramatic art form involving live, collaborative performances by actors in front of an audience. The definition of theater as a physical site refers to a structure, typically featuring a stage, where these performances are held. There are various kinds of theaters with various architectural styles used for different acts that the venue hosts.  The goal of this kind of theatrical design is to create a feeling of closeness between the audience and the actors. It is the only art form that includes all forms of expressionâ€”dance, music, literature, fine arts, and many more and should be encouraged for everyone. It enhances one's creative, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual qualities; it also builds confidence and teaches children teamwork and coordination, skills that will certainly come in handy in the future. Acting also helps with speech, body language, and sensory integration.</p>
